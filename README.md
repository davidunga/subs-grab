## SubsGrab - A subtitle grabber based on OpenSubtitles API

Basic subtitle scanner and downloader, for use alongside local streaming services. SubsGrab scans media directories for NFO files (generated by local streaming applications) with missing corresponding subtitle files, and attempts to downloaded them from opensubtitles.com. 

### Setup:
1. Make sure your streaming application is configured to save metadata locally.
2. Create a credentials.json file under /subs-grab, with your opensubtitles credentials:
```json
{
  "username": your-opensubtitles-username,
  "password": your-opensubtitles-password,
  "api-key": your-opensubtitles-api-key
}
```

### Usage:
Grab subtitles for media under [media_dir] recursively:
</br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;subsgrab.py [media_dir] [langauge(s)]
</br>
#### Example:
1. Grab English subtitles for media under ~/movies:
</br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;subsgrab.py ~/movies en
</br>
2. Grab subtitles with priority to Spanish, then English, then French:
</br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;subsgrab.py ~/movies es,en,fr
</div>
