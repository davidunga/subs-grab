## Subtitle Grabber

A simple subtitle downloader based on OpenSubtitles API, for use alongside local streaming services. Subtitle Grabber scans media directories for NFO files (generated by local streaming applications) with missing corresponding subtitle files, and attempts to downloaded them from opensubtitles.com. 

### Setup:
1. Make sure your streaming application is configured to save metadata locally.
2. Create a credentials.json file under /subtitle_grabber, with your opensubtitles credentials:
```json
{
  "username": your-opensubtitles-username,
  "password": your-opensubtitles-password,
  "api-key": your-opensubtitles-api-key
}
```

### Usage:
Grab subtitles for media under \<media_dir\> recursively:
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subgrab.py \<media_dir\> [--lang \<langauges\>]
</br>
#### Example:
Grab spanish subtitles for media under D:\Media\TvShows
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subgrab.py D:\Media\TvShows --lang es
